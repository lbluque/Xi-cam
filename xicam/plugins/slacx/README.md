## Synopsis

`slacx` is designed to be a fast, lean, and modular 
workflow manager for image-like data.

Many operations are pre-loaded into `slacx` 
for performing routine analysis,
and additional operations can be written 
by following the templates included in the manual.  
`slacx` also provides a plugin module
so that it can be used as a component 
of the `xi-cam` software package.
The complete documentation of `slacx`
can be found in the `doc` directory 
of this repository.

## Code Example

Instructions for using `slacx` 
through the GUI and through the API (not yet implemented)
are included in the user manual. 
See the `doc` directory of this repository.
A low-overhead usage example will eventually be posted here.

## Motivation

The main goal of `slacx` is to make processing of image-like data 
fast, intuitive, and customizable, all at the same time.
Processing includes input, basic operations, visualization, 
and storage of raw and processed data.
An eventual goal is to leverage 
processing capabilities and access to data stores
to provide feedback to control parameters of an experiment. 

## Installation

`slacx` will soon be packaged as a Python wheel.
TODO: put instructions here on how to install the wheel.

The installation instructions for a variety of platforms from source,
included in the user manual, will be continually updated.

## API Reference

The API is not yet implemented. It will be described here.

## Tests

TODO: Write a test suite for `slacx`.
Put instructions here on how to run and interpret the test suite.
