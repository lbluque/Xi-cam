## Synopsis

`slacx` is designed to be a fast, lean, and modular 
workflow manager for image-like data.
It is written for users to design and execute workflows
either from a GUI (for testing and debugging)
or from text commands written into an input file
(for rapid or large-scale batch processing).
It also runs a network client 
for packaging and storage of data
on any accessible server specified by the user.

Many native operations are pre-loaded into `slacx` 
for performing routine analysis,
and additional operations can be written 
by following the templates included in the manual.  
`slacx` also provides a plugin module
so that it can be used as a component 
the `xi-cam` software package.
The complete documentation of `slacx`
can be found in the `doc` directory 
of this repository.

 
## Code Example

Instructions for using `slacx` 
through the GUI and through input files
are included in the user manual, which can be found
in the `doc` directory of this repository.
A low-overhead usage example will eventually be posted here.

## Motivation

The main goal of `slacx` is to make processing of image-like data 
a fast and intuitive process,
including basic operations, visualization, 
and structured storage of raw and processed data.
An eventual goal is to leverage 
processing capabilities and access to data stores
to provide feedback to experimental parameter spaces. 


## Installation

`slacx` will soon be packaged as a Python wheel.
TODO: put instructions here on how to install the wheel.

The installation instructions for a variety of platforms from source,
included in the user manual, will be continually updated.


## API Reference

When the developers have added entry points
for using the `slacx` libraries in other codes,
it will be documented here and in the user manual.


## Tests

TODO: Write a test suite for `slacx`.
Put instructions here on how to run and interpret the test suite.
